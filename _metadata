  "description" : "This mod requires a character creator extender, like this one: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729426722\nWhile not technically required, Many of this mod's sprites are made to support Futara's fullbright mod: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2422986190\n\nSo here we are with my third species mod. Unlike my last mods, I wanted to go more sci-fi than fantasy this time.\n\nScyphojel are space jellyfish. \nThey hover above ground with some type of levitation, and can produce electricity at the ends of their tentacles. They're genderless and reproduce through strobilation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strobilation\n\nScyphojel tend to prefer living in spacecrafts rather than living on planets.\nThey build their structures with living materials like corals. Lately, there's been a fascination with retro alien technology. The Scyphojel are used to using their living technology, so the idea of constructing electronics with simple, non-living components is exciting to them. Some Scyphojel insist that this is just a fad.\n\n\nI want to give a huge thank you to Nebulox for letting me use their weapon coloring script. With this script, most Scyphojel weapons are recolored to one of the colors you selected for your character.\n\nMod Features:\n------------------------\nScyphojel species:\n-Since they're bioluminescent, they have the same glow effect the Novakids have.\n-Some notes about Scyphojel wearing clothing that isn't made for them: \n\t-They are compatible with most hats. \n\t-Most sleeveless shirts will probably look a bit big on the jellies. \n\t-Sleeves will display in the wrong place when you sit, but will otherwise be fine.\n\t-Back items should be fine.\n\t-Legwear will not fit at all.\n\nArmor:\n-Racial armor for all 6 tiers (Half are based on true jellyfish [Scyphozoa] and the others are based on various cnidarians)\n-Only 2 cosmetic shirts, because jellyfish are hard to design for, and I wanted to release this mod this year.\n-Obligatory invisible clothes\n\nWeapons:\nScyphojel weapons have a ranged theme to them. There's three types of weapons:\n-Charge Guns are one-handed arm cannons that can either fire a weak shot, or be charged to fire a strong shot.\n-Bubble Guns are two-handed rifles that fire short-ranged bubbles in four shot bursts. \n-Whip Bracelets are one-handed melee weapons that create a long tentacle whip when swung. It's swung in a two step combo; the first attack is swung in a wide arc, and the second is a narrow, high-knockback attack    \n\nTiles and Furniture:\n-A small set of furniture available in teal and yellow. (A chair, table, bed, computer, and crate)\n-3 tiles (Mesoglea Block, Coranthlite Slope, Corajel Glass\n\nSpace Villages?\n-There are two variants of space villages you can come across. They work like space stations, so if you find a star system with one, it will always be there.\n\n\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Can I make an addon for this mod or use assets from this mod?\n  A: Yes! I only ask that you: \n\t1. Don't use Nebulox's weapon color script without their permission. It's the only thing in the scripts folder.\n\t2. Don't use my assets for something that isn't compatible with this mod.\n\nQ: How do you pronounce 'Scyphojel?'\n  A: You can pronounce it as SIGH-foe-gel or SKY-foe-gel because no one seems to agree on how 'Scyphozoa' is pronounced.  \n  \nQ: Why do they still have footstep sounds.\n  A: It doesn't seem possible for me to remove footstep sounds from just the Scyphojel.",
