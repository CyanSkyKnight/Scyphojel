    "The Scyphojel (Pronunciation: Either SKY-foe-gel or SIGH-foe-gel is acceptable), sometimes just called \"space jellies\", are a spacefaring jellyfish-like species. Their bodies are made of a gelatinous material that they can rapidly regenerate if damaged. They can produce large amounts of electricity using the glowing ends of their tentacles. As they typically live in anaerobic enviroments, Scyphojel do not breathe. ",
	
    "Scyphojel live in parts of space with high amounts of bioluminescent life. The home \"world\" of the Scyphojel, really a collection of several living space stations built in an asteroid field overgrown with space fauna, is called Jellascyphi (Pronunciation: gel-uh-SKY-fee/gel-uh-SIGH-fee) It orbits around the three stars of the Psysciphisol (Pronunciation: SIGH-sih-fee-SOL) system.",
	
    "Scyphojel have a fascination with retro alien technology, to the point where they prefer using it to their own tech if they can. The Scyphojel are used to using their living technology, so the idea of constructing electronics with simple, non-living components is exciting to them. Some Scyphojel insist that this is just a fad that will disappear in a decade.",
	
	"Scyphojel are genderless, and reproduce asexually through a process resembling strobulation. Oddly, this process doesn't produce genetic clones of the \"parent\", but rather different Scyphojel; with different glow colors, bells or even antennae.",
	
	"While Scyphojel can eat organic food, their favorite food tends to be various metals. It's theorized that their bodies use this metal diet to produce electricity and levitate themselves."
